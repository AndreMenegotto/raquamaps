Introduction
------------

`raquamaps` is a set of tools that make it easier to produce Aqua Maps - model-based large-scale predictions of natural occurrences of marine species. The default model uses estimates of environmental preferences with respect to depth, water temperature, salinity, primary productivity, and association with sea ice or coastal areas. These estimates of species preferences, called environmental envelopes, are derived from large sets of occurrence data available from online collection databases.

It's already possible to create Aqua Maps using <https://aquamaps.org>, but the `raquamaps` package offers an open source alternative to the earlier MS Access based solution, which simplifies licensing issues and creates a solution which is easier to integrate, maintain and develop further.

This package can be used in an IDE like `RStudio` (recommended) or from an application like `QGIS` or the embedded UI can be used directly from a web browser in order to generate predicted distribution maps for marine species.

Installing from github
----------------------

If you want to install the latest version of the raquamaps package from github, you can do it like so:

``` r
# First make sure you have the devtools package
# which simplifies installations from github
# Note: Windows users have to first install Rtools to use devtools

install.packages("devtools") 

# install the raquamaps package from github with this command
# which may require RCurl, if so you can first install RCurl with ...
# install.packages("RCurl")

library("devtools")
#install_github('raquamaps/raquamaps', build_vignettes=TRUE) 
install_git("https://github.com/raquamaps/raquamaps.git", build_vignettes=TRUE)
# ... or if you have RCurl:
install_github("raquamaps/raquamaps")  
```

Quick start
-----------

Load the package in your R environment:

``` r
library("raquamaps")
```

To see some quick usage examples to get you started, open the Vignette.

Building this package - for developers
--------------------------------------

Open the raquamaps directory's .Rproj file in RStudio and use the Build tab to build a source tarball (it will use the version number in the DESCRIPTION file).

You may need to install a few libraries for the build to go through. R libraries can be installed from within RStudio. Or you could do it at the R prompt using commands like:

``` r
install.packages("RCurl")  
```

On some linux distros you may need system libraries, which can be installed like so:

``` console
sudo apt-get install libgdal1-dev libproj-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Don't forget to put the .tar.gz source tarball into the archive-tarball directory before pushing changes to gitorious/github.

raquamaps would have not been possible without many amazing R libraries, such as

-   dplyr, stringr etc from Hadley Wickham
-   rgbif etc from ROpenSci
